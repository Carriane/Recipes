<h1>Creole Pralines</h1>
<img src="images/pralines" alt="Pralines">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In Louisiana, especially New Orleans, the name praline applies to candies 
   made with pecans in a coating of brown sugar sold by Creole women known
   as pralini√®res. Even before the Civil War and Emancipation, pralines were an 
   early entrepreneurial vehicle for free women of color in New Orleans.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup dark or light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 stick (1/4 pound) butter</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>Dash of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 cups pecan halves (if pecan halves are large, crush in small pieces)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Put all ingredients except the pecans in a 3-quart saucepan
        and cook for about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once boiling starts, add the pecans. Stir and cook
        the mixture until the liquid forms a soft ball when a 
        little is dropped into cold water.</li>
    <li>Stir well and then drop by spoonfuls on the waxed paper.
        I find it convenient to place a small table near the stove,
        over which I put a few sheets of newspaper and then put the 
        waxed paper over that.</li>
