<h3>Description</h3>
<p> For some, ham hocks, andouille sausage, or bacon are a must; for others, it's pickled 
    or salt pork.But this New Orleans red beans and rice recipe perfectly captures the simple 
    perfection that defines the quintessential Southern dish.Back in Louisiana, the recipe was 
    originally a common dinner dish served on Mondays, the traditional wash day. The beans could simmer
    unattended while the cook was busy with the laundry and other chores. It was a perfect fit, easily
    feeding a crowd and being versatile enough to tailor according to what was in the pantry. After spooning
    these tender, flavorful red beans over fluffy rice, pair it with some of our perfect skillet cornbread
    and collard greens. The Southern-style sides take this New Orleans red beans and rice to the next level.
